# hyperapp-starter
*WIP* starter for hyperapp with HMR on both server and client side

I am using this as a project to learn a bit more about hyperapp, while also trying to contribute anything useful I can to their efforts.

## TODO: 
* ~~finish moving actions into src/actions/ with single actions object exported from src/actions/index.js~~
* add dynamic import for async route loading
* ~~look at client side dom "hydration"~~
* add bootstrap or similar simple styling...
* ~~JSDOM server side rendering~~
* ~~Webpack HMR on frontend and backend via Koa allowing for dev env to require only running npm run dev, no concurrently or npm-run-all non-sense~~
* ~~redux-devtools-extension integration with hyperapp state for time-travel debugging~~
